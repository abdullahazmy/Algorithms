### Sorting Algo


> Comparison Sort vs Count Sort
-  Comparison sort is O(N) or O(NlogN)  -> like INsertion Sort, selection sort
-  Count Sort depends on the frequency


The [insertion sort](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/Algorithms/blob/main/sorting-algo/insertion_sort.cpp) algorithm, is faster than the [selection sort](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/Algorithms/blob/main/sorting-algo/selcection_sort.cpp)
  both of them takes a time complexity of O(N^2) but the insertion sort at the best case is O(N), while in the selection is also O(N^2)

- As the selection sort doesn't depend on test cases, it will always work with the nested loops, while in the insertion sort
It will work in the nested loop in case of worst case

- The complexity of [Count Sort](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/Algorithms/blob/main/sorting-algo/countSort.cpp) is o(mxVal) + o(n)
