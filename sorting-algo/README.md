### Sorting Algo

The [insertion sort algorithm](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/Algorithms/blob/main/sorting-algo/insertion_sort.cpp), is faster than the [selection sort](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/Algorithms/blob/main/sorting-algo/selcection_sort.cpp)
  both of them takes a time complexity of O(N^2) but the insertion sort at the best case is O(N), while in the selection is also O(N^2)
