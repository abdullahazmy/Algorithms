## Forward & Backward Edges

In graph theory, a forward edge refers to an edge where the starting time of the source node is less than the starting time of the neighboring node. On the other hand, a backward edge is an edge where the starting time of the source node is greater than the starting time of the neighboring node.

`started[node] < started[neighboring] = forward`
