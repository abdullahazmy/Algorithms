## What is Greedy Algorithm?

is a type of optimization algorithm that makes locally optimal choices at each step to find a globally optimal solution.
It operates on the principle of `“taking the best option now”` without considering the long-term consequences.

It prioritizes immediate benefits over long-term consequences, making decisions based on the current situation without considering future implications.
