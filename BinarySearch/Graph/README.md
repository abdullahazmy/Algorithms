# What is Graph?

Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. Itâ€™s used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

## Components of a Graph:

Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabeled.

Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labelled/unlabelled.

if the graph is fully connected or complete, yhen number of edges is `(N * (N-1) / 2)`

### Important Notes

A directed acyclic grapg **(DAG)** A directed graph with no directed cycles

Tree us an undirected graph hasing number of edges = N - 1
